Canary is an open-source project to help you implement a beautiful, functional search experience on your documentation site. 

At its core, Canary offers a set of UI components that you can implement on a documentation site. Connect these components to one of multiple search providers, whether local, in the cloud, or AI-based.

## Benefits

### Multiple integrations

Canary currently supports [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/), and [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) documentation site generators. Its components also integrate with other frameworks.

Canary offers [`local`](/docs/local/intro) and [`cloud`](/docs/cloud/intro) search options.
Use local search to quickly add search functionality to your docs, without the need for any accounts.

You can also migrate to Canary Cloud later for extra features.

```html-vue
<canary-root framework="docusaurus">
  <canary-provider-pagefind> // [!code --]
  <canary-provider-cloud api-key="KEY" api-base="https://cloud.getcanary.dev"> // [!code ++]
    <!-- Rest of the code -->
  </canary-provider-cloud> // [!code ++]
  </canary-provider-pagefind> // [!code --]
</canary-root>
```

### Lightweight, versatile components

Canary components are [web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components), easy for browsers to render.

<SizeChart 
title="Bundle size (Uncompressed)"
:labels="Object.keys(packages)"
:values="Object.values(packages)"
/>

### Modular and open-source

We have put a lot of effort into making the core parts of the project as modular as possible, and we welcome contributions! [Find and ‚≠êÔ∏è us on GitHub](https://github.com/fastrepl/canary).

## Use cases

### Improving keyword-based search results 

A typical search experience looks like this:

<KeywordSearchProblem v-bind="keywordSearchProblemExample" />

It can lead to support questions like this one:

<Chat
  left="üë§ hi there! how can i <strong>set limit for api cost?</strong>"
  right="Here is <strong>our documentation</strong> for that. (readthemanual.com/<strong>budget</strong>-and-rate-limits) üë§"
/>

With Canary, keywords are inferred.

<KeywordSearchSolution />

### Making search results easy to understand

As your documentation grows, users often need to spend more time finding answers to their questions.

<SearchDigestProblem v-bind="searchDigestProblemExample" />

With Canary, their questions are "answered" with references.

<SearchDigestSolution />
